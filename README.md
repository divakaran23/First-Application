First-Application
=================
A basic iOS application developed for learning.
UI is built using the storyboard which contains a couple of IBOutlets and an IBAction.
A navigation controller is embedded into the application to provide access to the second ViewController from the first ViewController.
The IBAction gets the value from a UITextView and prints it in the UILabel.
